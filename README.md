# Chrome Password Stealer for Windows

Just a little demonstration I made to demonstrate that a) browser password manager's aren't particularly secure, and b) that anybody plugging in a USB into your computer can covertly do plenty of damage (even if you happen to be watching them closely) without needing any specialized tools like Ruber Ducky or Bash Bunny.

This is a portable executable file, disguised to look like a text file at a glance, that will grab a copy of Chrome's saved password's and save it to its current directory.
